## Programming
I tend to use C the most, but I also write in JS, HTML/CSS, Go,  
Python, PHP, and a few others.

I also work with assembler often. I use NASM for x86 and GNU as for ARM.  

Other than programming, I sometimes repair/refurbish computers.  

## Why Free Software
I create free software not because I think proprietary software is evil, but because I think  
free software is better. My goal is to help people, to make the world a better place than how I  
found it. And I believe I can help people best with free software.
