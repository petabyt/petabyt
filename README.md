## Languages
I mostly often use C/ASM, JS, and HTML/CSS. Sometimes I will write in  
PHP, Golang, Java, and Python. I have only tinkered with Visual Basic, C#, C++.

Other than programming, I also sometimes repair/refurbish computers.  
I rarely use a soldering iron, just diagnosing problems and wires.  

I also run servers locally, see http://petabyte.heb12.com/server.html

## Why Free Software
I create free software not because I think proprietary software is evil, but because I think    
free software is better. My goal is to help people,  to make the world a better place than how I  
found it. And I believe I can help people best with free software.
