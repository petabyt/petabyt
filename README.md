## Languages
The languages I use the most in order:   
```
C
JavaScript
HTML + CSS (not very good at it)
PHP
Go
Java
x86 Assembly (NASM)
Corescript (language I made, does this count?)
Python
**I have only tinkered with some languages such as:**  
Visual Basic
QuickBasic
C#
C++
Windows Batch/Unix shell
```
I do not really enjoy learning programming languages (although I will when needed), let alone replacing them.
I spend my time actually writing code instead.

Other than programming, I also sometimes repair/refurbish computers.  
I rarely use a soldering iron, just diagnosing problems and wires.  

I also run servers locally, see http://petabyte.heb12.com/server.html

## Why Free Software
I create free software not because I think proprietary software is evil, but because I think    
free software is better. My goal is to help people,  to make the world a better place than how I  
found it. And I believe I can help people best with free software.
