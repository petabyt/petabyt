## Languages
The languages I use the most in order:   
```
C
JavaScript
HTML + CSS (not very good at it)
PHP
Go
Java
x86 Assembly (NASM)
Corescript (language I made, does this count?)
Python
QuickBasic
C#
Visual Basic
I have only tinkered with some languages such as:  
C++
Windows Batch/Unix shell
ZigLang
```
I typically am not the person to try out many different programming languages  
for fun, but I just use the language that works best for me.  

Other than programming, I also sometimes repair/refurbish computers.  
I rarely use a soldering iron, just diagnosing problems and wires.  

I also run servers locally, see http://petabyte.heb12.com/server.html

## Why Free Software
Because it helps people MUCH more than proprietary software. My goal is to help people,  
to make the world a better place than how I found it. And I believe I can help people more  
with free software.
